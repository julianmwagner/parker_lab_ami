Tools to set up an AMI for bioinformatics in Caltech's Parker lab

In order to get the machine set up, I ran the following steps:
- Create an ec2 instance of the following type: Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-0bbe6b35405ecebdb
- ssh to the instance
- run `git clone https://github.com/julianmwagner/parker_lab_ami/`
